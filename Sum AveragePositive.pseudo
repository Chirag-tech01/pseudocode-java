/*Pseudocode to find sum & Average of 3 positive Number */

Start
    Declare num1,num2,num3,sum as Integer
    Declare average as Float

    Input value for num1,num2,num3

    If num1 or num2 or num3 is Greater than zero
        Set sum=num1+num2,num3
        Set average=sum/3

        Output "The Sum of 3 Numbers is :" +sum
        Output "The Average of the 3 Numbers is : "+average
